- 👋 Hi, I’m @TommyHSr28 About Me
- Everyday is a challenge for me. I deal with Head Trauma which I believe was caused from multiple concussions while playing Football. I have other accounts in GitHub and other companies that I don't remember. I was a millionaire then lost everything from a Ponzi Scheme and now I am living in my car. I have also been a victim of Identity Theft which has been a nightmare for me. 
- I am married to a awesome Wife with 3 cool, kind hearted kids. Broken Hearted from the tragic loss of my oldest Son. I love my Philadelphia Sports teams and cannot go a day without listening to Metallica!
- 👀 I’m interested in ... all areas of Technology, Sports, Helping Others when I can.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Web Development. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... putting an E-commerce website together and hopefully make money to get my family out of the mess we are in.
