- 👋 Hi, I’m @TommyHSr28 

About Me:

- Everyday is a challenge for me. I deal with Head Trauma which I believe was caused from multiple concussions while playing Football. I have other accounts that I signed up for in GitHub that I don't remember which ones they are.

- I was a millionaire then lost everything from a bad investment 'Ponzi Scheme' and now my Wife and I are living in my car trying to get back on our feet. I have also recently been a victim of Identity Theft which has been a nightmare for me to clean up the mess it caused. 

- On a positive note I plan to start a blog to help others who have been in similar situations and use whatever I can to help them get through a difficult time even if they just need someone to talk to.

- I am happily married to a awesome Wife with 3 cool, very kind hearted kids. My Wife and I are Broken Hearted from the tragic loss of my oldest Son. I love my Philadelphia Sports teams and cannot go a day without listening to Metallica!

- 👀 I’m interested in ... all areas of Technology, Sports, Helping Others when I can.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Web Development. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... putting an E-commerce website together and hopefully make money to get my family out of the mess we are in.

- 📫 How to reach me ...by email at tommyhsr28@gmail.com

- 😄 Pronouns: ...He, Him

- ⚡ Fun fact: ...My favorite cartoon character is Bugs Bunny! Favorite movie is 'The Godfather' My former Head Coach in College Won NFL Coach of the Year 3x and Won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
